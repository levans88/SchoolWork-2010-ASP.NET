This website was a school group project written in 2010 in ASP.NET. The code has been sanitized so that it's not clear which class it was written for. Team member names have been replaced with "TeamMember" and photos have been removed.

I was only able to partially restore this project because the database was hosted on a server at the school.

Output.PNG is a screen shot showing the general layout of the page. It can run on IIS 7.5 (Windows 7's IIS).
