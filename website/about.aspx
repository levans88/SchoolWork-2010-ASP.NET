        About Us</p>
    <p class="style4">
         The Great Green T-Shirt Fund is a non-profit organization that is currently managed by TeamMember, TeamMember, Leonard Evans, and TeamMember.&nbsp; Great Green, as our 
         organization is commonly referred to as, is based out 
    of Denton, Texas. The four organization founders met as students at the University of North Texas 
         and decided to create a non-profit organization that would benefit areas in 
                                        need of clean water.
                                        
         <br /><br />Keeping up with UNT tradition, they came up with the idea to sell t-shirts and 
                                        donate the funds to go towards water purification systems in countries in need 
                                        of clean drinking water. The community of Denton County has always been one for giving to those in need.&nbsp; 
                                        The members of the Great Green T-Shirt Fund formed to keep that tradition alive.
